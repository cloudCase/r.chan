# r.chan
member-based channel control script for mIRC


Allows for controlling a channel with options for members, or owners. A future update will include channel levels for half-op (+h), op (+o), and channel admin (+a). members by default are voiced (+v), and owners are given channel admin (+a) status. Also allows for relaying between two networks on the channel.
